# Monte Carlo Simulations

This directory contains materials from my tutorial on Monte Carlo simulations for USC JumpStart on June 29th, 2023.

* The subdirectory "Code" contains code we worked on in the tutorial, as well as some additional code.
* The subdirectory "Slides" contains a pdf of the slides from the tutorial. The slides also explain the code in detail.
